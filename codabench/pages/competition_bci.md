# Registration

> You must **first register** for Track 02 - BCI Decoding before you can participate. **Registration takes three steps.** Open **Get Started → Registration Guide** in the menu on the left. Follow the approval instructions and, if applicable, the additional setup required for teams.

---

# Before building a submission

> To be evaluated successfully and appear on the leaderboard, every uploaded model must follow the **strict Codabench submission contract**. Before preparing and uploading your model, open **Get Started → Submission Guide** in the menu on the left. It defines the Python inference contract, output shape, trained weights, optional files, and validation workflow. The same guide and its executable examples are public in the **[2026 competition repository](https://github.com/neural-interfaces26/2026-competition)**.

# After uploading: when will my score appear?

> **Your submission may remain queued before evaluation starts.** All four tracks share the same evaluation queue, so your score may not appear immediately. You can leave the page and return later; refreshing the Codabench webpage will not accelerate the evaluation process.

# Track 02 · BCI Decoding

> **Sealed-phase specification.** The description, task contract, and ranking metric below define the final three-command phase. Warm-up uses the public PROTEUS training release instead. Phase-specific differences are detailed below.

For focused answers about the public release, split, preprocessing, stream boundaries, adaptation, inference metadata, and scoring aggregation, read the **[Track 02 Scientific FAQ](https://github.com/neural-interfaces26/2026-competition/blob/main/codabench/pages/scientific_faq_bci.md)**.

_Decode a user’s intended mental command reliably across recording sessions._

Given a short 41-channel EEG window, predict one of three cued commands: **kinesthetic motor imagery, mental subtraction, or word generation**. Source recordings are sampled at 500 Hz and transformed by the published competition pipeline into 4-second, 120 Hz windows in microvolts. Sealed evaluation combines later sessions from represented participants with recordings from participants absent from the public release, testing both session drift and inter-person transfer.

## Sealed-phase task contract

|                          |                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Input**                | Four-second windows from 41 EEG channels, resampled to 120 Hz                         |
| **Prediction**           | One class index for motor imagery, mental subtraction, or word generation             |
| **Objective**            | Maintain command decoding across sessions and participants                            |
| **Generalization shift** | Later sessions from represented participants and entirely new participants            |
| **Sealed split**         | Public early sessions support development; all sealed labels remain hidden            |

## Sealed-phase ranking metric

> **Balanced accuracy averaged across subject, session, and context cells. Higher is better.**

Within each subject, session, and context cell, balanced accuracy is the unweighted mean of recall across the three commands. The official score is then averaged across cells, so every subject-session-context combination contributes equally regardless of its number of evaluation windows. Plain accuracy is reported separately but does not determine the ranking.

## Development, warm-up, and sealed data

**Development and training.** You may train your model on any of the organizer-recommended public datasets in the **[main website’s dataset directory](https://neural-interfaces26.github.io/tracks.html#datasets)** or other data permitted by the Terms. The public **[Track 02 competition directory](https://github.com/neural-interfaces26/2026-competition/tree/main/tracks/bci_decoding)** contains the executable contract and metric, dataset adapters, editable worked solvers, Benchopt configs, and NeuralBench checkpoint wrapper.

**Warm-up evaluation.** Warm-up submissions on Codabench are evaluated on the public **PROTEUS** training release ([NEMAR nm000290](https://doi.org/10.82901/nemar.nm000290)), the Graz and BrainHero data of this track. The evaluation participants are the test participants of the [Track 02 NeuralBench start kit](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/auto_examples/biosignal_challenge_2026/plot_track2_eeg_to_bci.html) split, which assigns participants to training, validation and test (60/20/20, random state 33). Its windows hold the release's 41 EEG channels, filtered and resampled to 120 Hz, in microvolts. Codabench streams each session of each participant one window at a time, in recording order, and ranks by balanced accuracy over the three commands within each subject, session and context cell, averaged over cells; the context of a run is its interface, Graz or BrainHero. Balanced accuracy pooled over all evaluation windows and plain accuracy are reported separately.

The **[Track 02 NeuralBench competition guide](https://facebookresearch.github.io/neuroai/neuralbench/auto_examples/biosignal_challenge_2026/plot_track2_eeg_to_bci.html)** runs this configuration by default (`neuralbench eeg _motor_imagery_stream`). Its `test/bal_acc_stream_mean` averages balanced accuracy over sessions without separating the two interfaces, so it can differ from the warm-up score. The **[reported public baseline scores](https://neural-interfaces26.github.io/participant-guide.html#baseline-track-2)** use the public **PROTEUS** cross-subject split. Because the warm-up test data and labels are public, training overlap, overfitting, or leakage is possible. Warm-up scores are indicative only and support submission validation and iteration. Only the sealed phase determines the final ranking.

**Legacy warm-up.** Codabench previously used Dreyer 2023 for a batched two-class motor-imagery proxy with pooled balanced accuracy. The current PROTEUS warm-up instead uses 41 EEG channels, three commands, session-wise one-window streaming, and cell-averaged balanced accuracy, so prior submissions must be adapted and scores are not comparable.

**Sealed evaluation.** Codabench uses private recordings from the same 20-participant, six-session acquisition programme described in the **[main website’s dataset directory](https://neural-interfaces26.github.io/tracks.html#dataset-track-2)**. Evaluation combines later sessions from represented participants with participants absent from the public release. Recordings and labels remain hidden.
